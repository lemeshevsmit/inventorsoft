/**
 * This first task in Inventorsoft academy .
 * <p>
 * General Description
 * Implement your task and push to the public git repository.
 * Share the link with the mentor. Create a simple java class that will read
 * data from the console and will print results to console.
 * <p>
 * Task 1 (Maximal Rectangle, Matrix Challenge)
 * Have the function MatrixChallenge(strArr) take the strArr
 * parameter being passed which will be a 2D matrix of 0 and 1's,
 * and determine the area of the largest rectangular sub-matrix that
 * contains all 1's. For example: if strArr is ["10100", "10111", "11111", "10010"]
 * then this looks like the following matrix:
 * <p>
 * 1 0 1 0 0
 * 1 0 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 1 1
 * 1 0 0 1 0
 * <p>
 * For the input above, you can see the bolded 1's create the
 * largest rectangular sub-matrix of size 2x3, so your program
 * should return the area which is 6. You can assume the input will not be empty.
 * Examples
 * Input: ["1011","0011","0111","1111"]
 * Output: 8
 * <p>
 * Input: ["101","111","001"]
 * Output: 3
